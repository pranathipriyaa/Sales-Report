# Sales-Report
In this lab, I worked with a dataset representing a fictional company's sales and customer data.

The objective was to:

- Connect Power BI to a data source

- Clean and transform the data using Power Query

- Create various data visualizations

- Build an interactive report that tells a data-driven story

**Files in this Repository**

- Report_Project.pbix – The completed Power BI report file

- README.md – Documentation of the project (this file)

  Report Highlights

**Key visuals of the report:**

**Sales by Region:** A bar chart showing total revenue split across geographic regions

**Top-Selling Products:** A table listing the best-performing products by revenue

**Revenue Over Time:** A line chart visualizing trends in revenue across months

**Customer Segmentation:** A pie chart segmenting customers by loyalty or category

**Interactive Filters:** Slicers to allow users to explore the data by year, region, or product

These visuals demonstrate how data can be explored interactively to support business decision-making.
